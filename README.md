# Energy Forecasting Project

This project involves two forecasting problems. 
* Hourly energy demand forecasting
* Hourly wind power plant production forecasting 

[iTransformer](https://github.com/thuml/iTransformer), NeuralProphet, XGBoost and LightGBM models are implemented for next 1-hour and 24-hour forecasting. 

The objective is providing predictions for test.csv datasets which comprise only data of exogenous variables for a long horizon and do not include the time series of target variables.

Tested with Python 3.9.13 environment with pip installation.

> [!NOTE]
> The datasets (train.csv and test.csv) of both problems are private; therefore, they haven't been uploaded.
